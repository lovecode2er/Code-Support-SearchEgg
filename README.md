SearchEgg Maze


People think that the walls of the maze have magic power: a circle in the maze can bring good harvest to the fields, no children can have children, in short, can think of things, so people used to hold adult rituals in the maze.

Scientists generally believe that the labyrinth is a curved channel, separated by a wall. People hold ceremonies, dancing and performing places here.

Archaeologists in Scandinavia found a maze of stone as tall as human beings, named "Troy Fortress". An ingenious path leads to the Central Plaza. There was a girl waiting for her sweetheart, who was dancing to the girl through the intricate path.

Holly Borges, a famous Argentine poet, novelist and translator, describes the construction of a house where no one can find an exit. Perhaps even more bizarre, there is also a monster with a cowhead.

In Naturalis Historia, Old Pliny mentioned four ancient mazes: the Crete Maze, a maze in Egypt, Limnos and Italy. The word Labyrinth originally came from Plasgian, Greece, and later was absorbed by the ancient Greek language. It may be labrys in Lydian ("double-edged axe"), which symbolizes monarchy. The earliest labyrinth was the Royal Minos Palace in Crete, meaning "Double Axe Palace", which coincided with this statement. The word "-inthos" means "place" (such as Corinth, Corinth).


First, after entering the labyrinth, you can choose a road to move forward.

Second, if you encounter a dead end, you can go back immediately and make a mark at the intersection.

Third, if you encounter a fork in the road, see if there is any passageway. Yes, you can choose a passage to go ahead; no, you can go back to the original intersection along the original road and make a mark. Then repeat the second and third rules until you find the exit. If you want to search all parts of the labyrinth, you have to add another one, that is, you have to go through all the unmarked passages.
